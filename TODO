Introduce new items
Look over the pets perks (Droprates etc)
Redo NPC's drops and droprates
Look at instance tokens (How it works)
Redo raids (remove jad from hard) and add new items for rewards
Look at adding AOE weapons (Magic and Range only) - Don't overpower them
Add more world bosses (More frequently) and add items to them
Redo AOE instances (Monsters are OP asf die instantly LOL!)

Redo achievements rewards (buff them abit)
Add more upgradeable items (starter to mid tier) DONT OP THIS
Donator zone npcs needs drop table adding
starwars minigame needs doing + items to drops (could make this into starwars raids)
add KH raids (single player raids) + chest

Go through the DR items and see if any mage / range gear needs adding
Go through ::bis and remove stats from items that don't need them (Not hybrid gear)
Starwars Slayer (Gives bonus slayer points and has chance to drop darth vader etc)
Required 120 slayer (Has chance to drop BIS items)

Make SEPH 30k tribrid armour
Bring is new Magic armour (BIS)
Autocasting certain spells can bypass KC and can attack without runes

redo all DR items (require full set to have DR %).
